# 02-Neural-Network-Classification-with-TensorFlow-Exercises

In this exercise I did the following:

- Played with neural networks in the TensorFlow Playground and understood the importance of the learning rate value for model performance.
- Built a neural network for Binary Classification.
- Imported make_moons() classification dataset from Scikit-Learn library, visualised it built a neural network to fit it at over 85% accuracy.
- Trained a model with 88%+ accuracy on the fashion MNIST test set.
- Recreated TensorFlow's softmax activation function in my own code.
- Created a function to visualise multiple image predictions for the fashion MNIST.
